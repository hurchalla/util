# Util
A header-only library of various utility C++ files for use across projects.  A notable provided utility is Programming by Contract (for C++ and C) support.
The library requires only standard C++11 (with the sole exception of BitpackedUintVector.h which needs C++14), and it is compatible with all later C++ standards.
